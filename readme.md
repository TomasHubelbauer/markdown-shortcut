# MarkDown Shortcut

In this repository I attempt to reproduce what I think is a GitHub feature of treating a MarkDown file as a shortcut.

I've seen in this in the Mermaid repository here https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid where the `CONTRIBUTING.MD`
file is "redirecting" to a nested MarkDown file whose relative path is in the main file's content, and GitHub
treats this file in a special way as it has a dedicated "shortcut" icon.

Let's see if all it takes is for a file to have a relative path of another file in its body or there is more magic
to this that I am not privy to at the moment.
